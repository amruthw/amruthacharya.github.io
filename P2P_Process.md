# ðŸ“¦ Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Process â€“ SAP Ariba

This document outlines the typical P2P flow in SAP Ariba, based on my experience implementing downstream procurement processes.

## ðŸ”„ Key Steps:

1. **Purchase Requisition (PR) Creation** â€“ Initiated by end-users from catalog or free-text entries.
2. **Approval Workflow** â€“ PR passes through approval chain based on roles, departments, or thresholds.
3. **Purchase Order (PO) Generation** â€“ Automatically created and approved PRs generate POs.
4. **PO Transmission** â€“ POs are sent to suppliers via the Ariba Network.
5. **Goods Receipt (Optional)** â€“ Buyer confirms delivery of goods/services.
6. **Invoice Submission** â€“ Supplier submits invoice through Ariba.
7. **Invoice Reconciliation** â€“ Ariba matches Invoice with PO and GR.
8. **Payment Execution** â€“ Final payment is processed in SAP S/4HANA backend.
